# Smart-Distance-Measurement-and-Emergency-Alert-System
My semester project initially focused on developing a Distance Measurement Device, a tool designed to measure distances with high precision. Recognizing the potential for further enhancement, I integrated an additional safety feature into the device. This upgraded version now includes an Emergency Alert System that activates when an object is detected within 30 centimeters of the sensor. Upon detection, the device triggers a blinking light to signal an immediate alert, providing a clear visual warning in potentially hazardous situations. 
# Significance
This evolution of the project not only underscores the importance of accuracy in distance measurement but also highlights the critical role of proactive safety mechanisms in modern technology.
